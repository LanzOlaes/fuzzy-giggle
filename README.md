# Student to Engineer 

Welcome to my repository!  
This is a personal journey where I document my growth from **1st year to 4th year** as a Computer Science student.  
Inside this repo, you will find different projects that reflect my **learning progress, experiments, and improvements** in coding, problem-solving, and software development.

## Goals
- Improve step by step, project by project.
- Keep track of my skills over time.
- Share my learning journey with others.
- Eventually become a **skilled Software Engineer / Machine Learning Engineer**.
