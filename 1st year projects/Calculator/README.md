# Simple Calculator

A beginner-friendly **command-line calculator** created in Python by Lanz Olaes.  
This is my first project, and I will still keep improving it as I learn more.

## Features
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`) with quotient and remainder
- Square root (`sqrt`)
- Exponentiation (`^`)
- Quit option (`q`)

## How to Use
1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py

**Notes**

- Division by zero is handled with an error message.
- Results are shown as integers (except exponents and square roots).
- This is just my first version â€” I plan to add more features in the future!
